### Problem Statement
Create a website for Handcrafted Products where Indian artists can sell their product in the global market and the buyer can buy there . It will be the website for both buyers and sellers , where local artists and skilled artist can able to sell their artistic product globally.



### Overview

We’ve used MERN Stack

Single page(Frontend) website using React.js

For backend was handled using Node.js and   Express.js

Storage and database was handled using  MongoDB



### Demand Forecast

We intend to store the order information in a spreadsheet form so that we can forecast the demand automatically and easily.

Demand Forecast =(demand + actual item issue)/number of periods.



### Automatic Quality Check

For automatic quality check, our idea is to provide the users with rating after purchasing the product and store it as numbers in the database, and thus rank the products accordingly.



### Sentiment Analysis

We will store some strings like “good”, “excellent”, “nice” etc in the database, and if the user’s comment contain any such words in the comment after the purchase, we recommend them more such products.
